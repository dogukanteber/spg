# gsp

### Description
gsp( Generate Secure Password ) is a very basic script that generates a password which is almost impossible to crack. I have made it for my own passwords. You may ask "Is it really necessary to build your own when there already is many password generator?" I say "Why not?" It allowed me to practice and understand function pointers. If you wondered, check out the source code. It is really simple.

### Compile & Run
